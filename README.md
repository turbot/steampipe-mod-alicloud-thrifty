# Alibaba Cloud Thrifty Mod for Powerpipe

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Steampipe mods are [migrating to Powerpipe format](https://powerpipe.io) to gain new features. This mod currently works with both Steampipe and Powerpipe, but will only support Powerpipe from v1.x onward.

An Alibaba Cloud cost savings and waste checking tool.

Run checks in a dashboard:

Or in a terminal:

Includes checks for:

- Underused **RDS Databases**
- Unused, underused and oversized **ECS Instances**
- Unused, underused and oversized **ECS Disks** and **Snapshots**
- **OSS Buckets** without lifecycle policies
- Unattached **Elastic IPs**
- Unused **VPC NAT Gateways**
- [#TODO List](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-alicloud-thrifty/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)

## Getting started

### Installation

Install Powerpipe (https://powerpipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/powerpipe
```

This mod also requires [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) with the [Alicloud plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/alicloud) as the data source. Install Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/steampipe
steampipe plugin install alicloud
```

Steampipe will automatically use your default Alicloud credentials. Optionally, you can [setup multiple accounts](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/alicloud#multi-account-connections) or [customize Alicloud credentials](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/alicloud#configuring-alicloud-credentials).

Finally, install the mod:

```sh
mkdir dashboards
cd dashboards
powerpipe mod init
powerpipe mod install github.com/turbot/powerpipe-mod-alicloud-thrifty
```

### Browsing Dashboards

Start Steampipe as the data source:

```sh
steampipe service start
```

Start the dashboard server:

```sh
powerpipe server
```

Browse and view your dashboards at **http://localhost:9033**.

### Running Checks in Your Terminal

Instead of running benchmarks in a dashboard, you can also run them within your
terminal with the `powerpipe benchmark` command:

List available benchmarks:

```sh
powerpipe benchmark list
```

Run a benchmark:

```sh
powerpipe benchmark run alicloud_thrifty.benchmark.ecs
```

Different output formats are also available, for more information please see
[Output Formats](https://powerpipe.io/docs/reference/cli/benchmark#output-formats).

### Configuration

Several benchmarks have [input variables](https://steampipe.io/docs/using-steampipe/mod-variables) that can be configured to better match your environment and requirements. Each variable has a default defined in its source file, e.g., `controls/sql.sp`, but these can be overwritten in several ways:

It's easiest to setup your vars file, starting with the sample:

```sh
cp powerpipe.ppvar.example powerpipe.ppvars
vi powerpipe.ppvars
```

Alternatively you can pass variables on the command line:

```sh
powerpipe benchmark run alicloud_thrifty.benchmark.ecs --var=ecs_disk_max_size_gb=100
```

Or through environment variables:

```sh
export PP_VAR_ecs_disk_max_size_gb=100
powerpipe benchmark run alicloud_thrifty.benchmark.ecs
```

These are only some of the ways you can set variables. For a full list, please see [Passing Input Variables](https://powerpipe.io/docs/using-steampipe/mod-variables#passing-input-variables).

### Common and Tag Dimensions

The benchmark queries use common properties (like `account_id`, `connection_name` and `region`) and tags that are defined in the form of a default list of strings in the `mod.sp` file. These properties can be overwritten in several ways:

It's easiest to setup your vars file, starting with the sample:

```sh
cp powerpipe.ppvar.example powerpipe.ppvars
vi powerpipe.ppvars
```

Alternatively you can pass variables on the command line:

```sh
powerpipe benchmark run alicloud_thrifty.benchmark.compute --var 'tag_dimensions=["Environment", "Owner"]'
```

Or through environment variables:

```sh
export PP_VAR_common_dimensions='["account_id", "connection_name", "region"]' 
export PP_VAR_tag_dimensions='["Environment", "Owner"]'
powerpipe benchmark run alicloud_thrifty.benchmark.ecs
```
