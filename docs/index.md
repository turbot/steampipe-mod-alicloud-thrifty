# Alicloud Thrifty Mod

Be Thrifty on Alibaba Cloud! This mod checks for unused resources and opportunities to optimize your spend on Alibaba Cloud.

## References

[Alibaba Cloud](https://in.alibabacloud.com/) provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to authenticated customers on a metered pay-as-you-go basis or as subscription.

[Steampipe Mods](https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources#mod) are collections of `named queries`, and codified `controls` that can be used to test current configuration of your cloud resources against a desired configuration.
